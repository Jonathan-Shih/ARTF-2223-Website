			<h2> Who is Banksy? </h2>
			<p> 
			Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist, and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation. Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls, and bridges throughout the world.</p>

			<h2> Is it Banksy? </h2>
			<p> 
			I believe that it is not Banksy. First of all, Banksy is known for his exhibitionist art, where he often provides social commentary with his graffiti, which are often placed in public places. With that in mind, this piece is placed in the back corner of a parking lot, which is not a place that would get high traction and Banksy would not choose to place his art there. This artist also uses grey to blend the black and white together. Banksy, however, uses stencils, which often produces sharp edges between his colors.</p>
